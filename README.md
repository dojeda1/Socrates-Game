# Trial of Socrates

### About this Project

This is a text based adventure game inspired by the ancient tale of when Socrates was sentenced to death by a jury of his fellow Athenians. Playing as the philosopher himself, you make branching choices powered by IF/ELSE functions in JavaScript that lead to alternate endings. The goal is to find the historical ending or simply explore alternate timelines.
